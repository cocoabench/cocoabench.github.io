        <h1>Building a Better Benchmark for Agents</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">By The CocoaBench Team</p>
        <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #eee; margin: 40px 0;">
        <p>
            We launched <strong>CocoaBench</strong> to enable builders and researchers to train models their own way. Whether they're conducting studies or customizing models for new applications, the need for robust evaluation metrics has never been higher.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Traditional benchmarks like HumanEval or MBPP focus on atomic code generation. However, modern agents operate in loops: they plan, act, observe, and correct. Our research shows that models capable of high zero-shot performance often fail when maintaining state over long horizons.
        </p>
        <h2>The Challenge of State</h2>
        <p>
            In our experiments, we found that proprietary models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet maintain context significantly better than smaller open-source models, although the gap is closing with recent releases like Llama-3.

        <blockquote>
            "The future of benchmarking is not static QA pairs, but dynamic, interactive environments."

            We invite the community to submit their results to our leaderboard and help push the boundaries of what autonomous agents can achieve.
