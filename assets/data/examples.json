        "question": "You will be playing the 8-puzzle game. The puzzle's goal state is hidden; you must determine the correct target configuration by interacting with the interface. After identifying this target state, solve the puzzle from its initial state optimally—that is, using the minimum possible number of moves.\n\nA code can be checked at any time, and it changes as you make moves. Only the code shown at the moment you reach the correct target configuration with an optimal solution is valid.\n\nYour final answer must be that exact code.",

Yet it failed to recall this information at the end, highlighting a significant weakness in its memory management.\n\nInterestingly, the agent also attempted to \"hack\" the process by inspecting source code and making API calls, though these attempts were unsuccessful."
