After identifying this target state, solve the puzzle from its initial state optimally—that is, using the minimum possible number of moves.\n\nA code can be checked at any time, and it changes as you make moves. Only the code shown at the moment you reach the correct target configuration with an optimal solution is valid.\n\nYour final answer must be that exact code.",
